#WHAT IS PYSOS?
 
Pysos is used to parse sosreports and present related data is a more human-friendly style,
and in the process get to the interesting bits of the data, rather than having to manually sift through loads of log files and similar.


Pysos can also run on a local system, and for most modules this can be done on the fly using the bits under, for example, the /proc filesystem. 
In other locations, a temporary file is generated and then fed to pysos in the same manner as if pysos was running on a sosreport. 
The end result is the same however, in that pertinent data is parse, formatted and presented in a human-friendly style.


Pysos is written for Python2.7. 


#INSTALLING PYSOS

Installation is rather simple, and can be done in three steps:


1) Pull down this repo
2) # python setup.py install
3) # ln-s /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pysos/pysos.py /usr/local/bin


note for #3 you replace /usr/local/bin with /usr/bin or really any other directory in your $PATH if you wish. 


#USING PYSOS

From the output of --help:

>$ pysos --help
usage: pysos [-h] [-a] [-b] [-o] [-k] [-c] [-m] [-d] [-l] [-e] [-g] [-i] [-n]
            [--net] [-s] [-t] [-r] [--db]
             target [target ...]

>positional arguments:
  target         Target directory, aka the sosreport root. Use "/" to run
                 locally


The syntax is straight forward enough: `pysos [args] [target directory]` 

So, if you wanted to print OS and Memory information, you'd use: `pysos -om sosreport-directory`

Or, you could run it on your local system with: `pysos -om /`



#FEATURE REQUESTS


I'm always looking to improve pysos, so if you have a request for a specific feature please let me know on the GitHub page. **Please** remember however that the main goal of pysos is to parse output from a `sosreport` so the feature must be able to work solely on the information gathered from a `sosreport`.
